# SRAM_TRNG
A sample application to generate random numbers from SRAM. The application was developed using STM32 Nucleo F030R8 development board. Read this for more https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-generate-true-random-numbers-in-a-microcontroller-b0c65903ae84
BSP's were developed using Cube MX and the IDE used was Atollic true studio.

ToDo
The project is not completely loaded. This currently contains the random binary generated from the STM32. This can be used to verify the randomness.
